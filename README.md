# Music Carousel Hours

A robust school bell system for automated music playback.

## Description

This system is designed for a school environment, running on a dedicated **always-on mini PC**. It replaces a legacy bash script with a modern Python application featuring a smart music carousel, persistent state management, and easy crontab integration.

All code comments and internal logic are in Spanish (matching the school's language), while this documentation is in English for global accessibility.

## Features

*   **Smart Carousel (`SmartCarousel`)**: Guarantees no song repeats until all tracks in a folder have been played. It detects new songs automatically.
*   **Configurable Schedule**: Bell times are defined in `src/cron_helper.py` (`BELL_TIMES`) and can be easily adjusted to match the school's morning and afternoon shifts.
*   **Robust CLI**: Simple command-line interface to play music by type (`entrada`, `cambio`, `recreo`, `salida`).
*   **Crontab Integration**: One-command setup (`--setup-cron`) generates 11 cron entries with proper environment variables for audio playback.
*   **Persistent State**: Remembers the last played song and queue status in JSON, surviving reboots.
*   **Graceful Handling**: Skips playback on weekends and handles empty/missing folders without crashing.
*   **Logging**: Detailed logs to `/var/log/colegio-bell.log` (with fallback to project directory).

## Tech Stack

*   **Language**: Python 3.12.3
*   **Audio Player**: `mpv` (via subprocess)
*   **Scheduler**: System `crontab`
*   **Testing**: Strict TDD with `unittest` (73 passing tests)

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blak0p/Musica_Pureza_grao.git
   cd Musica_Pureza_grao
   ```

2. **Make the install and uninstall scripts executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   chmod +x uninstall.sh
   ```

3. **Run the installation script**:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

### Manual Install (Alternative)

1.  Ensure `mpv` is installed: `sudo apt-get install mpv`
2.  Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/blak0p/Musica_Pureza_grao.git`
3.  Navigate to directory: `cd Musica_Pureza_grao`

## Usage

```bash
# Play a specific music type (entrada, cambio, recreo, salida)
python3 bell.py cambio

# Setup crontab entries for the school schedule
python3 bell.py --setup-cron

# Remove crontab entries
python3 bell.py --remove-cron

# Check last played and next in queue
python3 bell.py --status
```

## Uninstallation

To remove the application and crontab entries:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

## Testing

The project follows **Strict TDD**. To run the 73 unit tests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```
